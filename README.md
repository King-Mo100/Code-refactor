# Horiseon Code-Refactor 

Horiseon is a website that informs readers about Search engine optimization(SEO), Online reputation management and Social media marketing.

## About this Repository
This website was originally created by Horiseon, I have completed a small amount of refactoring in comparison to the original so that the website could run efficiently, the layout remains the same however the fucntionality of the website has been improved.  There were a few issues with the original that needed to be addressed.  For example "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" was added so that the site could function on various devices.
